<h1 id="obj-c">Obj-C</h1>
<p>Objective-C is the primary programming language you use when writing software for OS X and iOS. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methods. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.</p>
