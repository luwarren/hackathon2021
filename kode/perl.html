<p>Perl is not a programming language by itself, but rather a group of programming languages which are interpreted and dynamic. The family includes Perl 5 and Perl 6 and development of both languages take place independent of each other. It combines the features of languages like C and shellscript, and is extremely versatile. Perl has seen a decline of users as Python has gained popularity, as the flexibility of Perl can be confusing for newer programmers, while remaining relevant for power users.</p>
