<h1 id="swift">Swift</h1>
<p>Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community. Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple&#39;s earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple&#39;s <em>Cocoa</em> and <em>Cocoa Touch</em> frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift&#39;s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades.</p>

<p>Swift code almost mirrors natural English, in addition to other contemporary programming languages. This readability makes it simpler for existing programmers from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to embrace Swift into their toolchain, especially when transitioning to the Apple OS. Learning Swift is a great introduction to modern programming concepts and best practices. Swift makes it easy to write software that is incredibly fast and safe by design. </p>
